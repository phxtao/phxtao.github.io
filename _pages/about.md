I am currently a postdoc at Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University.

My research interests are to understand the global soil carbon cycle (both organic and inorganic part) and its response to climate change.

In collaboration with my brilliant colleagues, we have developed a “PROcess-guided deep learning and DAa driven modeling (PRODA)” approach that integrates big soil carbon data, process-based models, and data assimilation and machine learning techniques to gain emerging understanding of global soil organic carbon storage. You can check our [methodology paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdata.2020.00017/full) and [science paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06042-3).

My postdoc project focuses on enhanced rock weathering to promote soil inorganic carbon as a scalable carbon dioxide removal method.
