Feng Tao is an incoming Assistant Professor in Climate AI at College of Information Science and Technology and 
Institute of Energy and the Environment (co-hire) at the Pennsylvania State University. He obtained his Ph.D. from Tsinghua University in 2023 and B.S. from Sun Yat-sen University in 2018. He was a Schmidt AI for Science Postdoctoral Fellow at Cornell University from 2023 - 2025.

The world must create new, science-backed solutions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and scalable carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approaches, which are essential to averting the most perilous climate impacts this century. The global soil system, with its potential to sequester billions of tons of carbon as organic or inorganic forms over durable timescales, represents a promising nature-based climate solution. However, key scientific questions regarding the soil carbon cycle—such as the mechanisms of formation, persistence, and the response of soil organic and inorganic carbon to environmental changes and land management—remain unresolved. This gap in mechanistic and quantitative understanding has impeded transferring knowledge from academia to policymaking and industry to develop and implement verifiable methods for soil carbon sequestration. The need for science-backed, data-verified solutions to promote soil carbon storage is more pressing than ever. 

Grounded in a proven track record of success and innovation in mechanistic modeling, big data analytics, and AI ([featured exmaple I](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdata.2020.00017/full)), Tao lab seeks to fundamentally advance soil carbon sciences and management toward climate mitigation solutions ([featured example II](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06042-3).). By concentrating on the two giants in the global soil system—soil organic carbon (SOC) and inorganic carbon (SIC)—Tao lab explores viable giga-ton CDR solutions that can bend the warming curve.
